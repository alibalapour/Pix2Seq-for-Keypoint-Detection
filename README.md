# CornerDetection
## Description
This project aims to develop a deep neural network model to detect keypoints in an image. The base architecture of the model is [pix2seq](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10852) and we modified it to make it proper for detecting x, y, and a class of a keypoint in an image. We use a pre-trained model in the encoder of the architecture to get the best results.

The input of the model is an image and the output is a sequence of tokens which are representing the coordinates of the keypoints in the input image. The pix2seq model consists of an encoder and a decoder, the encoder gets and image and generates a representation of it. The decoder is a language model which can generate result tokens.


To use the corner detection model, follow these steps:
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Install the required dependencies (you can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` command)
* Set config and datasets.
* Run train.py or inference.py to train or infer model.


## Train
To train the corner detection model included in this project, follow these steps:

* Run the train.py code by using this command:
```
python train.py --config-path=[path_to_config]
```

## Inference
To infere the corner detection model, follow these steps:

* Prepare a config file related to the selected training and set the path in inference.py code.
* Run the inference.py code by using this command:
```
python inference.py 
```

## Requirements
â€‹ The following packages and libraries are required to train the scene classification model:
* Python 3.8 or higher
* PyTorch 1.13
* adabelief-pytorch
* pytorch-cosine-annealing-with-warmup

Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
